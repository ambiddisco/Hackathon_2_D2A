In this project we explore the diffusion of pollen in Switzerland. We use visualisations depicting the country and different cantons, forecasting pollen concentration, and looking at different plants to gain some insights. We use API calls and various functions for our total overview. 

For project content, files and code, open the "pollenpackage" directory which contains all the work.
For the built project, see "pollenpackage_0.1.0.tar.gz", the built package.
